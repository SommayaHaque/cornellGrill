# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    Taking responsibility for our part of the project.
    Getting our work done on time.
    Asking for help before it's too late.

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.

    Getting everything done on time.

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

    We can meet over zoom if some people are cannot meet in person.
    We plan to meet Monday 6pm-7pm in Morrison Hall.

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    We plan to communicate with the client in person and over text.

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    Media finder: Searches for media that will be included in the site
    Content Finder: Creates text for site
    Form submitter: Submits forms and forwards to all members
    Client relations: Connects with client on updates and concerns

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

If you are struggling to complete your part of the project, let your team know early on. If anyone fails to deliver their part, they must hold responsibility for that. To make sure this does not happen, we can check in to make sure everyone is on track.

    TODO: discuss and document here

1. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

If we disagree, the team should listen to everyone and hear what each person has to say. Try to reach a compormise.

    TODO: discuss and document here

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?


If it's not working out, the team can come back and edit the document.

    TODO: discuss and document here

9.  What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

    Cornell Grilling Club will have a celebratory grilling session.

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300-prof@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
