            <p>"At the Cornell Grilling Club, we want to share delicious food with everyone. This means having a welcoming environment for anyone interested in learning how you can grill food. We know that it can be hard grilling your own food here at Cornell, so we want to make that available to everyone. Whether you're a expert at the grill or this is your first time, we welcome you to join us and become a part of our club!‚Äù
