    Safe grilling practices
</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Always clean your grill before and after use to prevent the buildup of grease and food debris that can increase the risk of fire. </li>
    <li>Use long-handled grilling utensils to avoid burns and keep a spray bottle of water or a fire extinguisher nearby in case of a flare-up. </li>
    <li>Keep raw meats separate from cooked foods to prevent cross-contamination and the spread of harmful bacteria.</li>
    <li> Use a meat thermometer to ensure that meats are cooked to a safe internal temperature, and avoid serving undercooked or raw meats.</li>
    <li> Always supervise the grill when in use and never leave it unattended, especially when children or pets are nearby
    </li>
</ul>

<h3> Grilling instruments and their importance</h3>

<ul>
<li>Grill Brush: A grill brush is essential for cleaning the grates of the grill before and after use. This ensures that the food being grilled is not contaminated and helps to prolong the life of the grill.
</li>
<li>Tongs: Tongs are necessary for handling food on the grill, flipping it over, and removing it when it's done. It's important to use tongs rather than a fork to avoid piercing the food and allowing juices to escape. </li>
<li>Keep raw meats separate from cooked foods to prevent cross-contamination and the spread of harmful bacteria.</li>
<li> Meat Thermometer: A meat thermometer is an important tool for ensuring that food is cooked to the appropriate temperature, reducing the risk of foodborne illness.
</li>
<li> Grill Spatula: A grill spatula is ideal for handling delicate foods like fish and vegetables, as well as larger items like burgers and steaks. It helps to prevent the food from falling apart and allows for easier handling.
</li>
<li>Basting Brush: A basting brush is useful for applying marinades and sauces to food while it's on the grill. This helps to add flavor and moisture to the food and can also help to prevent it from sticking to the grates.
</li>
